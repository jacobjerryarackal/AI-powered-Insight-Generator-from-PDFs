# SuperAI Document: Your AI-powered Insight Generator from PDFs

SuperAI Document is a powerful Streamlit application designed to extract and analyze text from PDF documents, leveraging the advanced capabilities of Google's Generative AI, specifically the Gemini-PRO model. This tool uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to offer precise, context-aware answers to user queries based on the content of uploaded documents.

## Features

- **Instant Insights**: Extracts and analyses text from uploaded PDF documents to provide instant insights.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Utilizes Google's Generative AI model Gemini-PRO for high-quality, contextually relevant answers.
- **Secure API Key Input**: Ensures secure entry of Google API keys for accessing generative AI models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Google API Key: Obtain a Google API key to interact with Google's Generative AI models. Visit [Google API Key Setup](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to get your key.
- Streamlit: This application is built with Streamlit. Ensure you have Streamlit installed in your environment.

### Installation
